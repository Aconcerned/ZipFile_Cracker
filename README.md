# ZipFile_Cracker
C# program to crack password protected .zip files and .7z files

A simple Password cracker for Password Protected zipped files and folders that use the extension (.zip or .7z).

Password Lists can be downloaded from  https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/Passwords

I personally had "rockyou.txt" and saved in the same directory that the program was running from.

We will be using "SevenZipSharp" downloaded from Nuget package manager

We will be using "7zip" found @ http://www.7-zip.org/

We need a 7zip dll file in our project when 7zip software is installed.

When 7zip is installed go get the dll file from "C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.dll"

Copy the "7z.dll" file and paste that dll file in the same directory that this program will run from.

A problem i ran in to was that the dll on first run would throw an error so make sure in visual studio "Properties >> Build -(uncheck Prefer 32 Bit) and leave Platform Target as ANY CPU.
